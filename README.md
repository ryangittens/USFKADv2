# [USFKADv2](http://eng.usf.edu/USFKAD)
USFKAD is an expert system used to solve Partial Differential Equations. It was first developed as a C++ program by S. Kadamani, A.D. Snider of the University of South Florida. The original USFKAD C++ program can be found [here](http://ee.eng.usf.edu/people/snider2.html). 

USFKADv2 is the ported version accomplished by [Ryan Gittens](http://ryangittens.com), also of University of South Florida, as an Independent Study Course under Dr. A. Snider. 

The motivation to port the original USFKAD program was:

- To reduce frustrating mistakes made by unfriendly interface
- Be rid of the old school command line interface and bring in a mondern UI and UX
- Enable worldwide access
- Improve the PDE class at University of South Florida
- Do a fun project (for credits) that will get my name out there :)

The USFKAD was done using the original USFKAD C++ source code and modified open source components, mainly [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/).
